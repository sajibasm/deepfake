* Future Task: Model Training and Evaluation
- Automatically center-crop if face is detected?

Already Trained:
ResNet18

EfficientNet-B0 (youâ€™re about to or have started)

ðŸ”œ Recommended Next for Training:
XceptionNet

Pretrained on ImageNet

Performs well on facial manipulation detection

Can be imported via pretrainedmodels or timm

ðŸ”¬ Optional/Advanced:
ViT (Vision Transformer)

Attention-based, very effective if you have enough data or compute

ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Next?
If your goal is max accuracy or a research paper, consider this stack:


Phase	Model(s)	Use
Phase 1	ResNet18 + EfficientNet	Ensemble baseline
Phase 2	Add Xception	Accuracy improvement
Phase 3	Add ViT	SOTA-level experiment
Phase 4	Combine (Stacking / Voting)	Final ensemble
